<h2>The Start</h2>
  <p>
    I started out with Ubuntu in 2024, but I didn't learn/do much there, I only learned the very basics. The purpose of installing Ubuntu was to revive my grandma's old PC to be reused as a server. While it did that, the performance still wasn't all that great. Understandable though since it ran an HDD. I would have changed that if the manufacturer didn't block replacing hardware. Seriously, any time I tried to install a GPU or SSD it refused to boot with it! That's proprietary PC companies for you!
  </p>
<h2>The Rediscovery</h2>
  <p>
    I decided to try Linux again in mid-2025, so I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon. This is a great distribution for beginners who know <strong>nothing</strong> about Linux. It helped me to adapt to the Linux ways so I could finally get off Windows. I proceeded to daily drive it, along with Windows on my secondary drive. I only ever touched Windows when I needed something from it. That was a very rare case though, as there are a plethora of solutions and apps made for Linux to run Windows software. One that I love and personally use is <a href="www.winboat.app">WinBoat</a>. It is a Windows VM with a great GUI, and it is completely <a href="https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat">Open Source</a>. For the gamers like me, Steam offers a compatibility layer called Proton, it runs <strong>most</strong> games with Windows-like or better performance. Linux is <strong>not</strong> the hacker/programmer only OS everybody thinks it is. 
  </p>
<h2>Experimentation</h2>
  <p>
    After ~4 months, I was comfortable enough with Linux that I wanted to experiment a little. I decided to wipe my Mint drive and install Fedora on it. I tried it out for ~1 1/2 months. It also has beginner friendly aspects. I went with the KDE Plasma Edition, Plasma is a user-friendly and <strong>very</strong> customizable DE (Desktop Environment). Fedora was fun to use, and it helped me learn more. But I wanted to go further.
  </p>
<h2>Losing My Ability To Touch Grass</h2>
  <p>
    I decided to install Arch Linux, which is where I am now. I wiped my Windows drive, and i am now using it for general storage. This is a step above Gentoo and LFS, I don't plan on trying those in a while. I am not the typical Arch user stereotype, the header of this section is a joke, but I do think like an Arch user in some ways. I modify config files, and make everything look pretty. I've found that my Nvidia GPU works best with Arch, specifically on Wayland. Nvidia normally doesn't work well with Wayland, but it seems to work fine here with the exception of OrcaSlicer and some others. I would say switching to Arch Linux was the best decision of my PC life. It's lightweight, efficient, and non-resource intensive. I run my Minecraft server on it, and I still play games like Satisfactory on it comfortably with ultra settings. Arch Linux is <strong>not</strong> a good distribution to start on, as a lot of things are manual. Not to mention that it is a rolling-release distribution, so you get software right after release, broken or not. If you have time and like to debug/learn, Arch is for you.
  </p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    The software I mentioned before, WinBoat, is a personal favorite of mine so I would like to mention it again. It is created by TibixDev on <a href="https://github.com/TibixDev/winboat">GitHub</a> and is community-driven by people like you! You may find builds for your distribution <a href="www.winboat.app">here</a>.
